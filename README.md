# Disciple_of_Yeshua
John 14:6, Yeshua said, “I AM the Way — and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father except through me. 
                  
                       The most important Decision you’ll ever make!
                                    How will you spend eternity?               

1. Eternal Death

2. Eternal Life

First choice you don’t have to do anything, just continue the life your leading, your in control.

Second choice, takes action, you must repent, turn to God, confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Master, and believe in your heart that God raised Him out of the dead, you well be saved. To be continued....


The Hebrew word we translate as ‘repentance’ is Teshuvah, תשובה
Teshuvah is a lot more than a feeling of guilt or regret. In fact, it derives from the verb ‘to return’! Instead of being simply a state of mind, it is a decision. It is deciding to turn away from where you are headed and return to God where you can receive a new beginning

Everyone, whoever will call upon the Name of ADONAI he will be saved.

Romans 10:13
